## Variable
===============
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

--> Automatically
--> Using var
--> Using let
--> Using const

It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
## Note
=========
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

## When to Use var, let, or const?
==================================
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

## JavaScript Identifiers
=========================

---> All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

---> These unique names are called identifiers.

---> Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

## The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
===================================================================================

--->Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
--->Names can also begin with underscore, $ and letter.
---> space is not allowed.
---> Special character is not allowed except $(dollar) Symbol.
--->Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
--->Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
## Note
========
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
